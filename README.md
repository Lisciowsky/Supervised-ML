# Supervised Machine Learning Script

Initially, the script was used to carry out tests on NBA players' statistics.
However, with a bit of manipulation it may be modified as necessary.

The machine learning algorithms used:

Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Random Forest
Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression

The 'NBA_statistic.csv' file, contains player's seasonal statistics between
80-2017 along with "dummy variable". This data can be used as a basis for a study.
